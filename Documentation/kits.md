# Kits, Templates, Groups...
In Metalang, becuase everything is a building-block, we should begin assembling things into groups & templates, so as to avoid C programmer soup. Inspired by LEGO kits, but for programming.

Some sample kits include:
- **Math:** Mathematical computation
- **Logic:** Redifedining how humans process logic
- **Ada:** A tribute to the first programmer, Ada Lovelace. Contains classical algorithms.
- Etc...

## Samples of Kits

```js
Arithmetic("Showcase").int(64).plus().int(32)
```
